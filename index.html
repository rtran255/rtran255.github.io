      What Am I Learning About?
    </h1>
    <p>
      I'm currently a junior majoring in Management Information Systems at Texas A&M University. 
      I'm currently taking two courses related to information systems, ISTM 310 and ISTM 320.
      In ISTM 310, also titled "Network Communications and Infrastructure," I've learned about AWS, Wireshark, and how to create a website in GitHub.
      In ISTM 320, also titled "Business Systems Analysis and Design," I've learned about SCRUM, the foundation of information systems, data and process modeling, and much more.
      I've studied courses such as ISTM 250, which focused on learning programming with C# for a business setting, and CSCE110, where I learned about programming with Python.
