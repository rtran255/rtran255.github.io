    <h2>Generative AI Project</h2>
    <p>
      For this project, I am working with VEO 3, a generative AI service by Google, to create a unique video of Reveille X and her eye patch.
      I used a Meme from the Metal Gear Solid community, with an edit of the song "Invisible" by Duran Duran, to add to the AI-generated video. 
      The AI-generated video below shows one of the project's results so far, before I reached the limit of generation.

    <p>
      We are currently focused on creating a proper prompt to get the best results for the video as possible, with what we have below as our current results before the limit.
    </p>
     <ul>
      <li>GENERATE: A high-fidelity, photorealistic video of a collie dog wearing a tactical black eye-patch over its right eye.</li>
      <li>SCENE: The dog walks slowly and deliberately down a long, metallic, industrial hallway in a decommissioned military installation. The lighting is dark and dusty, illuminated only by a slow, intermittent red emergency light flashing from the ceiling.</li>
      <li>MOTION: The dog is in a low-angle tracking shot, walking at a dramatically slow pace. The clip must be generated to seamlessly loop like a GIF.</li>
      <li>NEGATIVE PROMPT (Things to Exclude): No people, no collar, no leash, no other animals.</li>
    </ul>
